"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable".

Bernard Shaw, Man and Superman


I am CEO and founder of Crossbar.io GmbH, a commercial open-source technology startup with a focus on IoT and Industrie 4.0.

Our core product Crossbar.io is an open-source message broker (middleware) which is especially suited for real-time, secure and seamless connectivity between microservices and application components. From factory floor and machine level, to backend systems, cloud and mobile.

I've been working with computers for 30+ years (got my first computer with 12 years, a 8 bit / 2kB RAM single board system) in various fields. I'm a passionate open-source hacker and privacy/security advocate. Last 10+ years I've helped large corporations from different sectors (telco, insurance, banking) build their data-warehouse / BI systems. I've used many programming languages over the years, lately I am mainly using Python, SQL, JavaScript and C++. My original background is in math (probability theory, machine learning).
